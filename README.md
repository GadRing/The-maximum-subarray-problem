Lke the chemicals the company produces, the stock price of the Volatile Chemical Corporation is rather volatile. You are allowed  to buy  one unit of the stock  only one time and then sell it at a later date, buying and selling after the close of trading for the day. To compensate for this restriction, you are allowed  to learn  what price of the stock will be in the future.
